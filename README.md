# POSIX Shell Scripts
----
The scripts in this repository are POSIX compliant for maximum portability. They
should be "plug and play" but you should stil audit the code for your own
understanding.

If you intend to use any of these scripts, it is important to ensure that they
are accessible by your ```$PATH```.

Make sure you ```shellcheck``` all scripts before using them.
